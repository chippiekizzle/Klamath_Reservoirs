# Klamath Reservoirs
Data analysis of the Klamath Reservoirs (Copco &amp; Iron Gate) from 2015 - 2020 using Sentinel-2 imagery. 

Use the Regression_Chla_GEE R code for analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery based on 4 spectral indices and in situ chlorophyll-a data (after downloading .csv files of the indices from Google Earth Engine using [this code](https://code.earthengine.google.com/2a174867fc402f1647e2e9e228d2644e). 

Use the Regression_Microcystin R code to analyze toxins data from Copco & Iron Gate Reservoirs (2015-2020). You can find chlorophyll-a and Microcystin in situ data from the [PacifiCorp website](https://www.pacificorp.com/energy/hydro/klamath-river/water-quality.html). 

[This Google Earth Engine code](https://code.earthengine.google.com/641db50ef7baf4ac53c6eadb39487cb6) will plot full time series charts of the 3 sample locations of this study without regard to in situ sampling days. These are atmospherically corrected.
